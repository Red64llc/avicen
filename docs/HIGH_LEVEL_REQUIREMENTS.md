# Open Source Health App "Avicen"

## Use Case #1:
John has been diagnosed with a hyperthyroid. 
He is under treatment but he has weekly blood tests and he needs to share the blood test, his level of TSH, with his doctor. 
He also needs to track the dosage of the medication he is taking. 
He wants to see, track, and make sure that he's taking his medication. He wants to track all the biology results, but he also wants to understand the relationship and the correlation between his health data, heart rate, respiration, sleep quality, with the medication and his biology report. 

## Use case #2:
Jane is taking care of her aging father.
Her father has been diagnosed with an immunodepressive disease called microvascularite.
Jane needs to track:
- Her father's medication
- The biology reports
She is also interested in understanding the correlation between the treatment, the medication, and the biology reports. She also wants to be able to share that with her father's practitioner.

## Here is what I want to be able to do with Avicen:
* Scan and analyze a prescription  and store the data. 
* Scan and analyze a biology report (from an image or an email) and save the data. 
* Import health data from Apple Health. 
* Import health data from Withings
* Extremely easy definition of prescription and dosage (maybe vocal). 
* From the prescription print out an easy-to-read and to-follow plan for someone that has a complicated treatment with morning and night dosage depending on biology report and dosage different between day, night, and day of the week. 
* Extremely easy tracking of taking or not taking medicine (maybe vocal)

Supporting features:
* Have access to a comprehensive dictionary of drugs, something like Vidal. 
* Detect conflicts between prescriptions given by two different doctors, for example, a cardiologist and an endocrinologist. 

## Target Device
This app is better run on a mobile.
We will pick a technology for the front-end that is compatible with running on the mobile. But it could be a web app if there is enough control to manage the camera. It could be using Rails 8 to build a mobile app or anything else. It could be using Rust. I don't care about the language or the stack, I just want something that is easy to deploy, fast to implement, and responsive.
