[20:47:13] ## Gap Analysis Complete ✓
[20:47:13] **Current State:**
[20:47:13] ### Key Findings
[20:47:13] - Strong foundation with authentication, Turbo Frames/Streams, Active Storage, and established service patterns
[20:47:13] The implementation gap analysis for the **biology-reports** feature has been successfully completed.
[20:47:13] - Proven patterns for user-scoped data management (Prescription, Medication models)
[20:47:13] - Existing autocomplete and file upload capabilities
[20:47:13] **Gaps Identified:**
[20:47:13] - Biomarker catalog model and seed data needed
[20:47:13] - JavaScript charting library (not currently in project)
[20:47:13] - Biomarker index/trend visualization UI patterns
[20:47:13] - Reference range validation logic
[20:47:13] **Recommended Approach:**
[20:47:13] - **Hybrid Strategy**: Extend existing patterns while creating new domain-specific components
[20:47:13] - **Phased Implementation**: Core CRUD → Advanced features → Visualization
[20:47:13] - **Effort Estimate**: M-L (5-10 days across phases)
[20:47:13] ### Document Location
[20:47:13] - **Risk**: Low-Medium (leverages proven patterns, allows incremental delivery)
[20:47:13] **`.red64/specs/biology-reports/gap-analysis.md`**
[20:47:13] ### Next Phase: Design Generation

[20:47:13] ```
[20:47:13] /red64:spec-design biology-reports -y
[20:47:13] ```
[20:47:13] **Priority Research Items for Design Phase:**
[20:47:13] 1. Biomarker catalog data source (High Priority)
[20:47:13] 2. Charting library evaluation: Chart.js vs ApexCharts vs CSS-only (High Priority)
[20:47:13] 3. Reference range sources and defaults
[20:47:13] 4. Active Storage PDF rendering capabilities
[20:47:13] 5. Autocomplete performance with large datasets
[20:47:13] Exit code: 0
[20:47:13] Success: true
