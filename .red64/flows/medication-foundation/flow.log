[14:22:33] ### Task 3.1: PrescriptionsController with full CRUD
[14:22:33] - Created `PrescriptionsController` with index, show, new, create, edit, update, and destroy actions
[14:22:33] - Strong parameters permitting `doctor_name`, `prescribed_date`, and `notes`
[14:22:33] - Cascading destroy via model's `dependent: :destroy` (medications, schedules, logs)
[14:22:33] - RESTful resource routes added
[14:22:33] - Flash messages for create, update, and delete operations
[14:22:33] - **24 controller tests** covering: full CRUD cycle, user scoping (other user's prescriptions return 404), cascading delete, validation errors, strong parameter protection
[14:22:33] ### Task 3.2: Prescription Views
[14:22:33] - **Index view**: prescriptions ordered by date (most recent first), active medication count badges, responsive card layout
[14:22:33] - All queries scoped through `Current.user.prescriptions` for data isolation
[14:22:33] - Mobile-first responsive layout using Tailwind CSS utility classes
[14:22:33] - **Show view**: prescription details with medication list, active/inactive status badges, drug name + dosage + form display

[14:22:36] ## Task 3 Implementation Complete

### Task 3.1: PrescriptionsController with full CRUD
- Created `PrescriptionsController` with index, show, new, create, edit, update, and destroy actions
- All queries scoped through `Current.user.prescriptions` for data isolation
- Strong parameters permitting `doctor_name`, `prescribed_date`, and `notes`
- Cascading destroy via model's `dependent: :destroy` (medications, schedules, logs)
- RESTful resource routes added
- Flash messages for create, update, and delete operations
- **24 controller tests** covering: full CRUD cycle, user scoping (other user's prescriptions return 404), cascading delete, validation errors, strong parameter protection

### Task 3.2: Prescription Views
- **Index view**: prescriptions ordered by date (most recent first), active medication count badges, responsive card layout
- **Show view**: prescription details with medication list, active/inactive status badges, drug name + dosage + form display
- **Form partial**: shared by new/edit views with doctor_name, prescribed_date, notes fields, error display
- Mobile-first responsive layout using Tailwind CSS utility classes

### Test Results
**232 tests, 698 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips** — 24 new tests added with no regressions. RuboCop clean.

### Next Steps
- `/red64:spec-impl medication-foundation 4` — Medication entry with drug autocomplete
- `/red64:spec-impl medication-foundation 5` — Complex dosing schedule management

[14:27:33] - **Strong parameters**: Permits only `doctor_name`, `prescribed_date`, and `notes`

[14:27:33] - **Flash messages**: Success messages for create, update, and delete operations
[14:27:33] - **Views**: Minimal placeholder views in `app/views/prescriptions/`
[14:27:33] - **Tests**: 24 comprehensive controller tests covering authentication, CRUD cycle, user scoping (404 for other user's data), cascading delete, validation errors, and strong parameter filtering
[14:27:33] - **Routes**: RESTful resource routes added to `config/routes.rb`
[14:27:33] ### Requirements covered: 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.5

[14:42:02] - `test/views/prescriptions/index_view_test.rb` - 16 tests (ordering, medication counts, empty state, responsive layout)

[15:58:10] ### Summary
[15:58:10] - Added `.includes(:drug)` eager loading to `set_medication` to prevent N+1 queries
[15:58:10] - Added 9 new controller tests covering Turbo Stream format responses, content verification, and HTML format redirects
[15:58:10] - Added `id="medications_list"` container to `prescriptions/show.html.erb` for Turbo Stream targeting
[15:58:10] - Enhanced the existing `MedicationsController` with proper `respond_to` blocks supporting both Turbo Stream (`format.turbo_stream`) and HTML fallback (`format.html`) for `create`, `update`, and `destroy` actions
[15:58:10] - Updated delete button in `_medication.html.erb` to use `turbo_stream: true` for in-place removal
[15:58:10] **Task 4.1 - MedicationsController with Turbo Frame responses:**

[15:58:10]   - `destroy.turbo_stream.erb` - removes medication element from DOM
[15:58:10] ### Files Modified

[17:46:20] **Task**: Create the schedule-builder Stimulus controller and schedule form views
[17:46:20] The TDD implementation agent wrote **56 view tests** and validated the existing implementation. The test-first approach caught and fixed **2 bugs**:
[17:46:20] 1. **Duplicate DOM IDs**: `schedules_list` was a static ID, causing conflicts when multiple medications exist on the same page. Fixed to use `schedules_list_medication_<medication_id>` for unique targeting.
[17:46:20] 2. **Missing empty state element**: The "no schedules" message was conditionally rendered only when empty, but the Stimulus controller needs it always in the DOM (hidden when entries exist) to toggle visibility dynamically. Fixed to always render with `hidden` class when schedules exist.
[17:46:20] ### Summary
[17:46:20] 3. **Turbo Stream target mismatch**: Updated `create.turbo_stream.erb` to use the medication-specific target ID.
[17:46:20] - **460 tests, 1404 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors**
[17:46:20] - 56 new tests covering: form fields, Turbo Frame wrapping, schedule list rendering, Stimulus controller integration, Turbo Stream responses, validation errors, empty state, and responsive layout

[22:45:58] ### 7.1 - MedicationLogsController (15 tests passing)
[22:45:58] - **Idempotent upsert**: Uses `find_or_initialize_by(medication_schedule_id, scheduled_date)` to prevent duplicates
[22:45:58] - **Auto-timestamp**: `logged_at` set to `Time.current` on creation
[22:45:58] - **Turbo Stream responses**: `create.turbo_stream.erb` and `destroy.turbo_stream.erb` for in-place updates
[22:45:58] ## Task 7: Medication Logging with Turbo Stream Updates
[22:45:58] - **User scoping**: All queries scoped through `Current.user` via prescription chain
[22:45:58] - **Routes**: `resources :medication_logs, only: [:create, :destroy]`
[22:45:58] - **Undo**: `destroy` action deletes the log, returning entry to pending state
[22:45:58] ### 7.2 - Stimulus Controller & Quick-Action UI (10 tests passing)
[22:45:58] - **Stimulus controller**: `app/javascript/controllers/medication_log_controller.js` with button-disable during requests
[22:45:58] - **Undo button**: Appears after logging, allows reverting to pending
[22:45:58] - **Skip reason**: Optional text field when skipping a dose
[22:45:58] - **Turbo Stream targets**: Unique DOM IDs per schedule entry for in-place replacement
[22:45:58] - **Quick-action buttons**: Taken/Skipped buttons on each pending schedule entry
[22:45:58] ### Next Steps

[00:28:16] Task 8.2 is **already fully implemented**. Here's what exists:

- **Controller action**: `weekly` action in `app/controllers/schedules_controller.rb` with `WeeklyScheduleQuery` integration, week navigation, and error handling
- **View template**: `app/views/schedules/weekly.html.erb` with 7-day grid layout, adherence status indicators, Turbo Frame wrapping, and week navigation controls
- **Routes**: `GET /schedule/weekly` defined as a member action on the singular schedule resource
- **Tests**: 15 controller tests covering authentication, rendering, content display, navigation, Turbo Frame integration, and error handling

There's nothing left to implement for task 8.2 -- it was already marked as completed (`[x]`) in the tasks file and the implementation matches.

### Next steps

You can run one of the remaining unchecked tasks instead:

- `3.2` - Prescription views (index, show, form partial)
- `4.2` - Medication views (form with drug autocomplete, list partial, toggle)
- `5.2` - Schedule-builder Stimulus controller and schedule form views
- `7.2` - Medication-log Stimulus controller and quick-action UI
- `9.1` - AdherenceCalculationService
- `9.2` - AdherenceController and adherence history view with heatmap
- `10.1` - Printable medication plan
- `11.1` - Navigation and Turbo loading indicator
- `11.2` - Flash message verification
- `12.1`, `12.2`, `12.3` - System tests
